	<div id="info"><b>Travelyze</b> is a travel application that can analyze your trip. It combines the power of Amadeus’ Extensive Flight Search with the elegance of the Google Maps API to provide you with important information about flight prices, tourist attractions, and popular landmarks, all on one easy-to-use website.<br><br>To use <b>Travelyze</b>, first enter the location of a place you would like to visit. If you select a large, well-known city, <b>Travelyze</b> will use an Amadeus/YapQ API to generate information about the top three landmarks of that city, as well as Instagram photos that have been posted near those landmarks. Next, enter the location you are currently at, and <b>Travelyze</b> will generate a Google Map image that shows you the start and end locations of your trip. After you confirm your choices, <b>Travelyze</b> will use Plotly’s graph API to create a user-friendly, interactive graph that shows you how airline prices will fluctuate throughout the year.</div>
